# Car Clash Game

**Car Clash** is a fast-paced obstacle runner on a **five-lane** road. The player starts with **3 hearts (lives)**; hitting an obstacle removes a heart and plays a **crash sound**, and the run ends at zero lives. Progress is tracked with an **Odometer (distance counter)**. Controls support **tilt sensors** (left/right) or **on-screen buttons** (slow/fast). The game includes a **menu screen** to choose the control mode and a link to the **leaderboard**, plus a **leaderboard screen** split into two fragments: a **local Top-10** table and a **map of record locations** that updates when a score is selected.
